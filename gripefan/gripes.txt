I'm on an Austrian Air plane, about halfway through a transatlantic flight.

I was just told by one of the flight attendants that alcohol was not being served for the nect three hours.  The thing is, a few minutes later, a woman asked for a glass of white wine from the same flight attendant.  She was given her wine.  So I asked the flight attendant, why the difference?  Apparently her boss (who I have to assume is the chief attendant on board) decided that I was to be shut down for three hours.

Now, I understand that the crew has the authority to make these kinds of decisions.  My question is, why me?  I truly was not being in the slightest unruly.  I can only assume that something I did was considered improper and for this reason I am being shut down.  I guess I should really ask her if I want to know, but in truth I prefer to simply decide that Austrians are not the kind of people I want to associate with.  Anymore.  Austrian Airlines is thus in my Do Not Fly list (with such illustrious sompany as Turkish Air, and Vueling).

This is OS66 from Chicago O'Hare to Vienna, Nov 13 2015.  And the offender is definitely the chief flight attendant, a lovely woman with reddish (brown) hair, about my age.

So there.
