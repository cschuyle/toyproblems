# brackitz

A coding challenge I got for an interview.  It was administered by
Hackerrank (on behalf of the actual interviewing compnay), but I
didn't submit this version (I submitted it in Java 7 instead, yes
chicken me).

The challenge is: strings containing balanced brackets of the () [] {}
variety (plus any other characters besides these, I elect to ignore),
are valid; otherwise (if the brackets are not balances), not valid. 

This has a bit of extra credit in it: It gives relatively good
validation error messages.

## Usage

Run the tests, or `lein run` and then enter lines at a time to get the
YES/NO answer as to whether the string is valid.
